üìä These are data analysis projects that I've worked on using Python, SQL and excel, utilizing visualization and various statistical analysis techniques to pull insights from data sets

  :bulb: These projects prepare me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects
  
 
# Project - Data Exploration - Covid-19 dataset

<img align="right" height="250" width="375" alt="GIF" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91241827/142728438-bb9aaef8-0505-4742-868c-b1870761469a.jpg" />


ü¶† Covid-19 : Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

‚û°Ô∏è In this project I use SQL to explore data about covid 19 and was able to get interesting insights, as it is a pressing issue now, I decided to analyze the covid data set to get some insights
<br />
<br />
‚û°Ô∏è Why a data exploration project? : Data exploration is the first step of data analysis used to explore and visualize data to uncover insights from the start or identify areas or patterns to dig into more. Using interactive dashboards and point-and-click data exploration, users can better understand the bigger picture and get to insights faster

To get the detailed findings of the covid dataset please check my tableau dashboard üëá

# Project - SQL Data Cleaning - Nashville Housing


<img align="right" height="250" width="375" alt="GIF" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91241827/142728335-2a3f2b78-8ca3-43d4-b523-c2bbf1ba2c4b.jpg" />

üè° Nashville : Nashville is the capital of the U.S. state of Tennessee, Nashville is known for having incredible sports teams, great schools, a solid economy, nationally recognized music and an affordable cost of living

‚û°Ô∏è Why a data cleaning project? : Having clean data will ultimately increase overall productivity and allow for the highest quality information in your decision-making. Benefits include: Removal of errors when multiple sources of data are at play. Fewer errors make for happier clients and less-frustrated employees.

‚û°Ô∏è So in this project I used SQL to clean the dataset, data cleaning is a aspect of data analysis that is often overlooked, So I wanted to do a project on data cleaning using SQL

# Project - Data Analysis using python

<img align="right" height="250" width="375" alt="GIF" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91241827/142728902-8b0754b7-d6f7-4c78-a2da-57fe4ea0660e.png" />

üêç In this project I will be using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn..using these libraries we will be finding correlations in the dataset

üé¶ We will be using a movies data set that contains data for movies from 1980 - 2020

üìà In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. In the broadest sense correlation is any statistical association, though it actually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related

‚û°Ô∏è Why a python project? : Python's built-in analytics tools make it a perfect tool for processing complex data. Python's built-in analytics tools can also easily penetrate patterns, correlate information in extensive sets, and provide better insights, in addition to other critical matrices in evaluating performance. So decided to do a python project in **Jupyter Notebook** and will be using its markup to show the insights
